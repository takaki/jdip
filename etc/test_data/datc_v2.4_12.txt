VARIANT_ALL DATC_1898

# Build fails until Home SC captured
# 
# jDip note:
# NOTE: The adjudicator does not consider any builds to be valid here, 
# since no home supply centers exist (thus there are no builds). 
# This order fails, because it is ignored by the adjudicator (which 
# states the reason why)
#
CASE 12.A [Home supply center must be captured]
PRESTATE_SETPHASE Fall 1901, Adjustment
PRESTATE_SUPPLYCENTER_OWNERS
	Germany: A War		# owned non-home supply center
	Germany: A Ber		# owned home supply center
PRESTATE
	Germany: A Ber		# a unit in home SC
ORDERS
	Germany: Build A Mun	# fails; Germany does not yet control this SC
POSTSTATE
	Germany: A Ber
END


# Builds are restricted to the home supply centers and not to the starting positions of the units.
CASE 12.B [Build on non-starting position allowed]
PRESTATE_SETPHASE Fall 1901, Adjustment
PRESTATE_SUPPLYCENTER_OWNERS
	Germany: A War		# owned non-home supply center
	Germany: A Mun		# owned home supply center
PRESTATE
	Germany: A War		# a unit in non-home SC
ORDERS
	Germany: Build A Mun	# succeeds
POSTSTATE
	Germany: A War
	Germany: A Mun		# new unit built
END


# The notion of home supply center still exists. 
# That means that builds in other supply centers are not allowed.
#
# NOTE: this will succeed if the order is "Build A Ber" instead.
# Also note, that if in PRESTATE a unit is in Berlin, no builds will
# be calculated (since the adjustment calculator knows that Germany
# has no home-supply centers that are unoccupied).
#
CASE 12.C [Can only build in Home supply centers]
PRESTATE_SETPHASE Fall 1901, Adjustment
PRESTATE_SUPPLYCENTER_OWNERS
	Germany: A War		# owned non-home supply center
	Germany: A Ber		# owned home supply center
PRESTATE
	Germany: A Pru		# a unit NOT in a supply center.
ORDERS
	Germany: Build A War	# fails; Warsaw is not a home SC
POSTSTATE
	Germany: A Pru
END

# When a unit has to be removed according to the civil disorder rules, 
# then the distance should still be calculated from the home supply centers 
# and not to the owned or starting supply centers.
CASE 12.D [Civil Disorder based on Home supply centers]
PRESTATE_SETPHASE Fall 1901, Adjustment
PRESTATE_SUPPLYCENTER_OWNERS
	Russia: A stp
PRESTATE
	Russia: F Black Sea
	Russia: F Norwegian Sea
ORDERS
	# ** no orders given ** [Civil disorder]
POSTSTATE
	Russia: F Black Sea 
	# F NWG removed, as it is farther from supply center at stp
END
