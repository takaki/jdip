 <h1>Saved Game File Format</h1>
 <h2>Introduction</h2>
 <p>
 The saved game file format is a compressed XML format which is interchangeable between
 platforms. The XML file format is robust and allows for improved compatibility between
 versions. After decompression, the XML file format may be manipulated (e.g., using XSLT)
 to other desired formats.
 </p>
 <h2>Compression</h2>
 <p>
 Saved game files are compressed using the <b>gzip</b> compression 
 (for more details, see <i>http://www.gzip.org</i>)
 format. A complete file will begin and end with &lt;jsx&gt; elements. Windows users may 
 use a program like WinZip or WinRar to decompress a gzip file; note that adding the extension
 ".gz" may help.
