 <h1>Creating Variant Plugins</h1>
 <p>
 Variants may be created from scratch or by modifying an existing variant in a
 variant plugin. Variant plugins are in the "variants" directory of the jDip 
 installation.
 </p>
 <p>
 Adding a variant plugin is as simple as moving the plugin file to the variants directory.
 </p>
 <p>
 Descriptions of the variant file formats are covered in the Advanced Topics section 
 of the help file. It is highly recommended to use the existing variant plugins as
 examples to get started. This is easily done, as a variant plugin is just a Zip archive
 file. 
 </p>
 <p>
 When creating variant files, it is recommended that a proper XML editor (or XML-aware
 editor) is used. At the very least, check your XML files to make sure they are valid;
 invalid XML will almost always cause jDip to report errors.
 </p>
 Please refer to the jDip web site (jdip.sf.net) for more information on creating
 your own variants.
