<h1>Order Checking</h1>
 <p>
 jDip has two levels of interpreting orders: <b>strict</b> and <b>lenient</b>. This 
 can be changed from the <b>Orders | Order Checking Options...</b> menu item, selecting
 <b>Order Checking</b> from list that then appears, and changing the option as desired.
 </p>
 <p>
 <b>Strict</b> order checking, the default, ensures that orders are syntactically valid 
 and legal. For example, a Fleet moving to an adjacent sea or coastal province would be 
 both syntatically valid and legal.
 </p>
 <p>
 <b>Lenient</b> order checking ensures that orders are syntactically valid, but not
 nescessarily legal. For example, a Fleet moving to an inland province or non-adjacent 
 space would be a syntactically valid order, however, it would not be a legal order. 
 This may be useful in no-press games, for example.
 </p>
 <p>
 Note that prior to adjudication, all orders are checked for legality (they always
 are checked using <b>strict</b> checking). Illegal or invalid orders will fail at 
 that time.
 </p>
 <p>
 Also note that while orders always must by syntatically valid, locations (Provinces)
 specified in an order must be found on the map, or jDip will complain.
