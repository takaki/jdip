 <h1>Entering Orders</h1>
 
 <h2>Order Entry Methods</h2>
 
 <h3>Using the Mouse</h3>
 <p>
 Orders may be entered using the mouse, by clicking on units or provinces on the map.
 The currently selected order (e.g., "Move") is shown on the button bar below the map. 
 A different order may be selected by clicking on it.
 <p>
 Orders may be entered by dragging the unit to the desired location, or by clicking
 on the desired location. The mouse pointer will give visual feedback to indicate if
 the action is acceptable for the given order.
 </p>
 <p>
 The statusbar will display both information about the space the mouse pointer is over,
 and display useful messages about the order entry process.
 </p>
 <p>
 When the mouse pointer is over the map, the first letter of the order name can be 
 used as a shortcut (e.g., "h" for Hold, "m" for Move, etc.).
 </p>
 
 <h3>Using the Order Box</h3>
 <p>
 Orders may be entered by typing or pasting them into the text box, which is located
 just above the <b>Order List</b> and under the current game phase display. The Enter
 key must be pressed for the order to be accepted. Orders that are accepted will clear
 the text box; orders that fail will remain for editing.
 </p>
 <p>
 If multiple orders need to be entered, the Enter Multiple Orders window (described 
 below) may be used for easier order entry.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Entering Multiple Orders</h3>
 <p>
 If multiple orders need to be entered at once, either manually or by pasting them 
 in from another program, the Enter Multiple Orders can be used. This is available
 from the menu <b>Orders | Enter Multiple Orders...</b> selection.
 </p>
 <p>
 When entering multiple orders, each order must be on a single line. Orders that span 
 multiple lines, or multiple orders on a single line will cause orders to be misinterpreted.
 </p>
 
 <h2>Order Checking</h2>
 <p>
 jDip has two levels of interpreting orders: <b>strict</b> and <b>lenient</b>. This 
 can be changed from the <b>Orders | Order Checking Options...</b> menu item, selecting
 <b>Order Checking</b> from list that then appears, and changing the option as desired.
 </p>
 <p>
 <b>Strict</b> order checking, the default, ensures that orders are syntactically valid 
 and legal. For example, a Fleet moving to an adjacent sea or coastal province would be 
 both syntatically valid and legal.
 </p>
 <p>
 <b>Lenient</b> order checking ensures that orders are syntactically valid, but not
 nescessarily legal. For example, a Fleet moving to an inland province or non-adjacent 
 space would be a syntactically valid order, however, it would not be a legal order. 
 This may be useful in no-press games, for example.
 </p>
 <p>
 Note that prior to adjudication, all orders are checked for legality (they always
 are checked using <b>strict</b> checking). Illegal or invalid orders will fail at 
 that time.
 </p>
 <p>
 Also note that while orders always must by syntatically valid, locations (Provinces)
 specified in an order must be found on the map, or jDip will complain.
 </p>
 
 <h2>Changing Orders</h2>
 <p>
 Orders may be changed or deleted after they have been entered. To delete an order,
 or multiple orders, select the order or orders from the <b>Order List</b> and 
 press the "delete" key or select <b>Edit | Delete Selected Order(s)</b>.
 </p>
 <p>
 If a unit already has an order, and a new order is entered for that unit, the 
 new order will automatically replace the old order.
 </p>
 <p>
 If a mistake is made while entering orders, the <b>Undo</b> and <b>Redo</b> 
 menu options, under the <b>Edit</b> menu, can be used. Remember that Undo and Redo 
 are saved across games, so you can Undo and Redo actions all the way back to the beginning
 of the game.
 </p>
 
 <h2>Sorting Orders</h2>
 <p>
 Orders may be sorted using the buttons at the bottom of the <b>Order List</b>. By clicking
 a button, orders will be sorted (and stay sorted) by that button. Clicking the same button
 again will sort the orders in the opposite direction (for example, instead of alphabetical
 order, reverse-alphabetical order).
 </p>
 <p>
 A subtle background color will be applied to alternating groups, or alternating rows, as
 appropriate.
 </p>
 <p>
 <b>Province</b> sorts the orders alphabetically by Province name<br>
 <b>Power</b> sorts the orders alphabetically by the Power name<br>
 <b>Unit</b> sorts the orders alphabetically by the Unit name<br>
 <b>Order</b> sorts the orders alphabetically by the Order name	 
 </p>
 
 <h2>Explicit Adjacent Convoys</h2>
 <p>
 For armies with a land route and a convoy route, the army is always 
 assumed to move over land. No attempt is made to determine "intent". 
 This is consistent with the DPTG (Diplomacy Players' Technical Guide). 
 </p>
 <p>		
 To force an army to travel by convoy, append to a move order the 
 phrase "by convoy" or "via convoy". For example: "A lon-wal by convoy"
 </p>
 
 <h2>The Waive Order</h2>
 <p>
 Unused builds do not need to be explicitly waived in jDip. However, some
 house rules or other adjudicators require builds to be explicitly waived.
 </p>
 <p>
 jDip fully supports the Waive order. It may be entered via the graphical 
 interface, or by typing in an order (such as "waive build london"). 
 Note that a province is required for a waive order to be accepted. Waive
 orders are shown as checkmarks over the supply center.
