	<DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[
		<p style="margin-top:0pt;">
		The Hundred Years' War Diplomacy variant of Diplomacy
		follows the most of the rules as standard diplomacy with
		a modified map.  The game was designed to allow a balanced
		three-player variant for quick games when 7 players are not
		available.  The game is called Hundred3 because it is
		designed for three players.
		</p>
		<p>
		Hundred3 simulates the end of the Hundred Years' War
		between France, England and Burgundy.  The game starts in
		1425, at the height of Anglo-Burgundian gains versus
		France.
		</p>
		<h2>Rules</h2>
		<ol>
		<li>
			The rules of "standard" Diplomacy are valid, unless specifically
			replaced or amended by these rules
		</li>
		<li>
			The standard map is replaced by the "Hundred" variant map.
			Northumbria has 2 coasts, West and East.  Aragon has 2 coasts,
			North and South.  Castile is not divided into coasts, so fleets
			entering Castile from Biscay can then proceed to the Mediterranean
			and vice versa.
		</li>
		<li>
			All references in the "standard" rules to specific powers,
			provinces, locations, and seasons do not apply to "Hundred".
		</li>
		<li>
			The game begins in 1425. Each turn represents 5 "real time" years,
			and has a movement phase followed by a retreat phase.  Alternating
			turns will have an adjustment phase (after retreats if required),
			the first being in 1430.  The Judge and jDip do not follow this
			convention, so Fall 1425 follows Spring 1425, etc.
		</li>
		<li>
			There are 17 supply centers on the board.  The winner is the power
			which holds 9 or more supply centers during an adjustment phase.
		</li>
		<li>
			 To represent the reliance on underpaid mercenary units, France
			 begins the game with more units than it can afford.  The army in Provence
			 is considered a mercenary unit, and as Provence does not start in an SC,
			 France must capture at least one SC in 1425 to maintain all 5 units.
			 <p>
			 Should France fail to capture an SC, it will be forced to remove one
			 unit, however, it need not be the actual unit which starts in Provence.
			 Instead, if it wishes, the French ruler may discharge other troops and
			 keep the Provencal unit in his service.
			 </p>
			 <p.
			 Other than this first year of no support, the unit in Provence is
			 identical to all other French units, and its entry into conflict is at
			 equal strength with all other units.  Even in 1425, the unit moves and
			 supports at full strength.
			 </p>
			 <p>
			 Provence is NOT a Supply Center and no units may be built there, nor
			 does occupation of Provence provide any support for any units.
			 </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			A power may build in any vacant supply center it owns during an
			adjustment phase, assuming at least one of the original SCs of that
			power is owned by that power: thus while there are permanent "home
			centers," as long as you own one, all owned centers act like home
			centers.  For example, Burgundy may build in London if (1) it is
			vacant, (2) Burgundy owns London, (3) Burgundy is eligible for a build
			and (4) Burgundy still owns at least one of: Holland, Flanders, 
			Luxembourg, or Dijon.
		</li>
		<li>
			Units (armies and fleets) may move or give support from London
			to Calais or vice versa regardless of the presence of a fleet
			in the Strait of Dover.  Examples:
			<div class="indent05cm" style="margin-top:7pt;">
				<code>E: LON-CAL. B: FLA-CAL.</code> Result: all bounce.<br>
				<code>E: LON-CAL, DOV s LON-CAL.  B: FLA-CAL.</code> Result: LON-CAL succeeds.<br>
				<code>E: LON s CAL, CAL H. F: PAR-CAL, DOV s PAR-CAL.</code> Result: CAL holds<br>
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			Note that all provinces of these use the first three letters of a province with the
			exception of:
			<p style="margin-left:1cm;">
				<b>bch</b>   Bristol Channel<br>
				<b>brt</b>   Brittany<br>
				<b>ech</b>   English Channel<br>
				<b>nmd</b>   Normandy<br>
				<b>num</b>   Northumbria<br>
				<b>nth</b>   North Sea<br>
				<b>dov</b>   Strait of Dover<br>
				<b>was</b>   The Wash<br>
				<b>pal</b>   The Pale<br>
			</p>
		</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h2>History</h2>
		<div class="indent1cm">
			<p style="margin-top:0pt;">
			Note, Hundred3 adds The Pale, The Atlantic, Anjou,
			Charolais, and Alsace, and removes the French center in
			Provence (moving it to Castile as a neutral), but is
			otherwise unchanged from Hundred V1.1.  In addition, the army in provence
			which existed in Hundred remain, but now must find a supporting SC or risk
			elimination.
			</p>
			<p>
			Hundred 3.1 adds in the mercenary army in Provence.  
			This was an adjustment for game balance based on the Hundred3 NoPress 
			Tournament of 1997 in which Burgundy had a marked advantage.
			</p>
			<p>
			Unlike Standard Diplomacy, Hundred does not fully distinguish between home
			supply centers and initially neutral supply centers.  All but 4 supply
			centers (and all non-SCs) are named for regions rather than cities.
			This is to represent the importance of the duchies and counties for
			which the participants in the Hundred Years' War fought.  In addition,
			the designation between home and neutral SCs is of less importance since
			all owned/unoccupied centers can build units.
			</p>
			<p>
			The four exceptions to the general rule of naming SCs for provinces are
			the 3 capital cities of London, Paris and Dijon, and the city of Calais.
			Calais kept a city name because of the unique importance of the port of
			Calais within Artois, but Artois and art are also valid names.
			</p>
			<p>
			Some provinces which are now named for regions were originally named for
			cities when hundred was first tested.  These names and abbreviations
			have been left coded into the judge for old-timers to use.  Thus Holland
			can also be referred to as Amsterdam(ams), Flanders as Antwerp (ant),
			Orleanais as Orleans, and Devon as Plymouth (ply).
			</p>
			<p>
			The name of Aquitaine was changed to Guyenne to represent the
			nomenclature in the 15th century, but Aquitaine (aqu) is still a valid
			name for judge purposes. In addition, some non-SC centers can also be
			referred to by old-style names: Lorraine was Swabia (swa), Aragon was
			Catalonia (cat), Castile was Iberia (ibe), and Northumbria was
			Northumberland (the latter is really a much smaller subset of the
			former).
			</p>
			<p>
			You'll be able to tell an early Hundred player if he suggests A Aqu-Cat
			instead of A Guy-Ara.
			</p>

		<h2>Credits</h2>
		<div class="indent1cm">
			<p style="margin-top:0pt;">
			The variant was designed by Andy Schwarz with help from Eric Coffey, as
			well as fabulous input from the hundreds of players of the original
			Hundred.  Larry Richardson was the JK who dealt with us to get it coded up
			originally.  Dave Kleiman was kind enough to deal with this variant during
			some trying times as we ported over to USIN, and Nick Fitzpatrick played a
			major role in revising the initial set-up to V1.1.  Version 2 was tested by
			Nic Chilton and Doug Essinger-Hileman, and the slight change to this
			Version (Hundred3) was helped by David Norman, with corroborating input
			from Kristian Dorph Petersen.  The mercenary army in Provence was added
			after serious testing by the rt-dip crowd.

		Hundred 3.2 differs from Hundred 3.1 in that the English fleet that starts in
		Devon now starts in the English Channel. Note that England begins the game with
		5 units and 5 Supply Centers, so it is not a "mercenary" army as is the French
		Army in Provence. Devon, at the start of the game, is unoccupied.
