   <b>How to stop variants from appearing in the New Game window that I do not want?</b>
   </p>
   <p>
   Find the directory (folder) underneath the main jDip program directory called "variants". 
   Delete the .zip file containing the variants you do not want. Note that some of the variant
   packages may have more than one variant (for example, sailhoVariants.zip contains both
   Sail Ho! and Sail Ho! Crowded).
