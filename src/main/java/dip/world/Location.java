     *
     * For example:
     * F gas-spain
     *
     * Now, using the simple validate() method, the above order would fail, becuase
     * spain/nc must be specified. However, a fleet in gascony can ONLY move to
     * spain/nc; thus the specification should be optional. If the fleet could move
     * to EITHER coast, then this method offers no gain, and an error will occur.
     *
     * Essentially, this 'loosens up' the validate method to account for orders that
     * are legal and yet not ambiguous.
     *
     * However, we need to know the 'from' location.
     *
     * This only applies to fleets that are moving into multicoastal provinces.
     *
     * some examples:
     * F gas-spa       ** illegal; no coast specified
     * F gas-spa/nc    ** ok
     * F gas-spa/sc    ** illegal; non-adjacent
     * F mar-spa/sc    ** ok
     * A gas-spa       ** ok (army)
     * A gas-spa/nc    ** ok (coast ignored for armies)
     * A gas-spa/sc    ** ok (coast ignored for armies)
     *
     *
     *
     *
     * This should only be used in Move orders; it should not be used in Convoy orders,
     * since only Armies can be convied, nor should it be used for Support orders, since
     * the destination province may legally be a loose or 'unreachable coast' match.
     *
     * NOTE: 'from' MUST BE adjacent to this location for this to work, with a defined
     * coast. Thus the 'from' location should be fully validated before this method is used.
     *
     * NOTE: This method may return a new Location object, if changes were made,
     * or the same Location object, if no changes were made.

     * <pre>
     * This extends the simple getValidated() method, by performing
     * additional validation/checking given turnstate information.
     *
     * It is most appropriate for unit source orders. Given the following
     * order:
     * F xxx SUPPORTS yyy-zzz
     * It would be most appropriate to validate the location "xxx" with this
     * method. This is because a unit exists in "xxx", and we can derive/match
     * any existing information (coast type, in particular) from the unit.
     *
     * It would also be appropriate to validate location yyy with this, because
     * we know that a unit must exist in yyy (otherwise the order is invalid).
     *
     * Thus coast ambiguities are removed.
     *
     * This should NOT be used for validation of destination locations. This is because
     * no unit may be in the destination location, and even if there is it wouldn't make
     * sense; for example:
     * F gas-spain/nc
     * A spain
     * If we used getValidAndDerived() for "spain/nc", we would derive the coast from the
     * army in spain, which would be illegal. Thus a simple validate or a move validate
     * should be used instead.
     *
     *
     * So: The method works as follows:
     * 1) calls validate()     "simple validate"
     * 2) if unit type is a fleet: (if army, we're done)
     * a) if coast undefined, derive coast from unit
     * b) if coast is defined, ensure that it matches the
     * coast of the unit.
     *
     * Fixed: we must give the unit (or null, which may cause a failure).
     * The reason to give the unit is that a dislodged unit or
     * non-dislodged unit may be req'd depending on what we are
     * validating (e.g., retreat orders derive against dislodged
     * units)
     *
     * A Coast will never be undefined after this method completes.
     *
     * NOTE: This method may return a new Location object, if changes were made,
     * or the same Location object, if no changes were made.

     * 2) Any coast that is not illegal is acceptable. In other words:

     * 1) Always in Coast.WING
     *
     * NOTE:   coast may be equal to Coast.UNDEFINED (Coast.ANY) with succesful validation.
     * This is intentional! This allows less specific location to match a more specific
     * location (e.g., SUPPORT xxx-yyy, and a MOVE zzz-yyy/nc; unspecific "yyy" will
     * still match the more specific "yyy/nc")
