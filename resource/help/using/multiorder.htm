<h1>Enter Multiple Orders</h1>
<h2>The Enter Multiple Orders Window</h3>
 <p>
 Multiple orders may be entered at one time using this window. Orders may be typed
 in manually, or pasted in from another source. When <b>Accept</b> is clicked, all orders
 are processed and the orders that failed and the reason it failed are displayed.
 </p>
 
<h2>Hints and Caveats</h2>
 <p>
 Orders for different powers may be entered on the same screen, except in Face-to-Face
 games. Only one order is allowed per line. jDip makes every effort to parse a
 recognizable order into a valid order; non alphanumeric characters and odd spacing
 is ignored. Extraneous characters at the beginning of an order are also usually ignored.
