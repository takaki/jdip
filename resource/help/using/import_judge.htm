 <h1>Importing Judge Files</h1>
 <p>
 jDip allows the import of files created by the online email Judge system.
 The allowed files include: game history files (single or multiple turns),
 game listing files, and turn result files. 
 </p>
 <p>
 For more information about online Judges, see <i>www.diplom.org</i>.
 </p>
 <p>
 Only variants supported by jDip may be imported.
 </p>
 
 <h2>How Importing Works</h2>
 <p>
 If a game is already open, Judge import first checks to see if the game name
 is the same. If the game name is the same as that being imported, <b>and</b> 
 the game phase is the same, the imported turns will be added to the current 
 game. Games with the same name but different phase can be rewound to the correct
 phase for importing to resume.
 </p>
 <p>
 If no game is open, or, the name of the currently open game is not the same
 as that being imported, jDip will create a new game from the imported data.
 </p>
 <p>
 If a game listing is imported, a starting position with appropriate player
 information will be created.
 </p>
 <p>
 If a game history is imported (single or muliple turns), jDip will create a 
 game with all imported turns.
