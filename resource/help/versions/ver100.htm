<h1>Version History: 1.0</h1>
<h2>jDip version 1.0 (September 2003)</h2>
<pre>
 - New and Improved Features:
     + Face-to-Face (F2F) mode; games started in this manner have each power separately 
             entering orders. After a power submits his or her orders, they remain hidden
             until order resolution occurs.
     + Youngstown Variant, with a detailed map (by Martin Asal), added
     + Maps can now be exported as PDF files
     + Better order drawing: 
             + Move and Hold orders have thickness proportional to support.
             + Better rendering of Support orders and merging with Move/Hold orders
             + A red "X" is drawn over failed orders when in review mode
             + Disband and Remove orders now drawn over (instead of under) units
             + Drawing speed improvements
     + Better result reporting:
             + For bounces and dislodges, the province from which the unit bounced or
                     was dislodged by is displayed.
             + Statistics are now reported (attack:defense) for bounces and dislodges
             + Moves that fail because another move failed reported 
             + General style and formatting improvements
     + Better turn status reporting:
             + Clearer formatting
             + Improved descriptions for adjustment orders
             + Indication of blocked builds due to home SC occupation
             + Number of units without orders is reported (if at least one order is submitted)
     + Better order parsing:
             + Control characters and odd whitespace characters now ignored
             + Garbage text in front of orders, in "Enter multiple orders", is now (usually) ignored
             + More tolerant of Province misspellings due to new matching algorithm
             + Improved formatting of invalid orders in "Enter multiple orders" dialog
     + Undo/Redo makes it easier to unwind (undo) a game to a turn in the distant past
     + Scroll bars on map window now disappear when not needed.
     + Text improvements on Topological and Simple standard maps
     + Long (Full) province names added to Hundred variant maps
     + Short (Abbreviated) province names added to Standard Traditional map
     + Edit mode prompting and information displayed in statusbar
     + Faster map setup time (by about 20%)
     + Map Editing tool to help with unit, supply center, and text placement created
 - GUI changes:
     + Order Input text box not shown when in modes that disallow order input
     + Edit mode: dislodged units can only be added in Retreat phase
     + Order sorting method changed to combo-box instead of buttons
     + Eliminated "advance after resolve" option in prefs; resolution now always advances the turn.
     + Eliminated "show MRU files" option in prefs; most-recently used files are always shown
     + Edit mode: power selection box is now the correct size
     + Confirmation required when saving or exporting over an existing file
     + Main window now starts up larger
     + More help available
     + Filtering of URI and Email address input in Game and Player Information window
     + File modified indicator more descriptive
     + Nicer FileNotFound error

     + Fixed: Save game directory (in Preferences) not used when set
     + Fixed: Scrolling bugs

     + Levenshtein distances used to determine Province matches (when appropriate)
     + Tool plugins now have their own directory     
     + Selective control over which powers may enter and display orders
     + GameSetup object controls game restoration
     + Improved event creation, event handler cleanup
     + Streamlined menu code and event handling
     + ErrorDialogs are now logged
     + MapPanel changes (lazy loading, fixed reload issues)
     + TestParser / Convert removed from standard distribution
     + Splash.java improvements to detect errors in end-user Java configurations
     + General code cleanups and improvements

 - Miscellaneous:
     + Version 1.0 can read version 0.95 saved games, however, version 0.95
       is not be able to read saved games created from version 1.0.
     + Issue: there may be a several-second delay after a map is loaded before
       it is responsive. Internal processing is occuring during this time. This
       has to do with the Batik library (which displays the map SVG graphics),
       and will be worked around in a future version if possible.
