<h1>Version History: 0.95</h1>
<h2>jDip version 0.95 (May, 2003)</h2>
<pre>
    - New Features:
        + Drag-and-Drop can be used to enter orders (Colin Jacobs)
        + Edit mode improvements (Colin Jacobs)
        + Animate mode allows turn-by-turn animation of the map
        + Influence setting in View menu shows all occupied/last-occupied provinces by power
        + Order format (e.g., abbreviations of provinces, coasts, etc.) can be
                set and adjusted in Preferences
        + Help System added (F1 to get help generally, or about specific windows).
                Note that Help text is not yet complete, and not all windows
                have specific help.
        + New variants (with complete, detailed maps)
                + SailHo! Crowded
                + Hundred3.1 [H31]
                + Hundred3.2 [H32]
        + New variants (with very spartan grid-maps) added:
                + Asia
                + Modern (with and without Wing units)
        + A new type of unit, the Wing unit, is now optionally available for any variant.
        + Games now saved as compressed XML, and incompatible with previous versions (sorry!)
        + Improved order parsing
                + Some common misspellings added
                + Even more variations of orders are now legally accepted
        + improved command-line parsing and new command-line options (such 
                as enabling logging, getting the version, and setting the variant 
                plugin path)
        + Java Webstart is now supported
        + Waive orders are no longer supported. 
        + Better support for Mac OS X-specific features, which have not yet
                been tested. These may be disabled via the "-noosx" command line parameter.
                Comments from Mac users are very much desired!
        + Save Game and Variant file format documentation
        + Started scattered localization in French. Note: I barely remember any French.
    - GUI changes / improvements:
        + "Reports" menu added; report items were previously contained under "View" menu.
        + Removed "Validate XML files" from preferences (could cause buggy behavior
                when enabled); it is now a command-line option instead.
        + Improved text rendering quality in many places.
        + Improved error dialogs (text and formatting)
        + Shortcut changes (control R = resolve, control E = results)
        + New startup splash screen (Joeri Clayes)
    - Bug Fixes:
        + Fixed: TestSuite now uses "variant" directory, so it actually works
        + Fixed: Remove orders drawn in wrong area
        + Fixed: Retreat orders drawn in wrong area
        + Fixed: No text displayed in game-end dialog
        + Fixed: Formatting and display issues in Status report
        + Fixed: Remove order results displayed negative units to remove
        + Fixed: View settings (e.g., Show Units) were not disabled during
                 map loading, and could result in an inconsistent menu / actual 
                 drawing state if selected.
        + Fixed: If a required variant was missing, there was a program
                 error. Now, an informative error message is displayed.
        + Fixed: Handling of uncaught AWT exceptions, for easier end-user debugging
        + Fixed: 1898 now starts in Spring, 1898 with fixed positions
        + Fixed: SVG private XML namespace well-formedness issues
        + Fixed: If no move orders (or no units), adjudicator would emit paradox
                 messages (although no paradox existed).
        + Fixed: supply center for Portugal wasn't drawn on rectilinear (topological) map
        + Fixed: Confusing error message about DefineState orders
        + Fixed: Creating a Dislodged unit on the first turn caused an exception
        + Fixed: Occasional display bugs when entering/exiting Highlight Unordered units mode 
    - Core changes:
        + Multiple Performance enhancements to core adjudication routines,
                for optimal speed in automated adjudicators. This results
                in a 15-30% performance increase from version 0.85, the 
                previously fastest version. This release will now become 
                the new baseline performance release.
        + JUnit tests added for non-GUI code (Mike Rosseel)
        + Much faster Position class, and position class API changes
        + New field and changes to Position and Position.ProvinceData classes
        + Province class API changes
        + Improved Path.getMinPath() algorithm
        + Phase class API changes to support YearType
        + YearType class added to Phase (to support negative, or "BC", years)
        + Reduced adjudicator String creation
        + Improved API documentation
        + Assertions enabled in ANT "Run" target
        + dip.misc.Convert to help convert Judge files to jDip XML adjacency format
        + dip.misc.Log class can now log to a file in addition to stdout
        + jcmdline (jcmdline.sf.net) is now used to parse command line options
        + New Coast constant (Coast.WING, aka Coast.TOUCHING) added
        + Coast.TOUCHING (Coast.WING) created automatically from adjacency graph
        + Coast.TOUCHING used for for Path.getMinPath() and Province.isTouching()
        + New Unit.Type: WING
        + New validation tests added (wing.txt, 19 cases) for Wing units
        + New validation test harness for OrderParser created
        + Utils.SimpleFileFilter is now in its own class (dip.misc.SimpleFileFilter)
        + CSS stylesheets can be--and now are--used in JEditorPane instances
        + Many new ANT targets: webstart, test, performance, and junit targets
    - Miscellaneous:
        + File-format incompatibility with all prevous versions. Games are now
          saved as gzip compressed XML, instead of a proprietary binary format.
          All future versions will also save files as compressed XML, and
          cross-version compatibility should be considerably improved.
