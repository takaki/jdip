 <h1 class="centered">Version Warning</h1>
 <p>
 The game you are attempting to open uses variant {0} version {1}, which is not
 currently installed.
 </p>
 <p>
 However, version {2} of the variant is available. The possibility of a version 
 incompatibility exists. If the game is saved, this message will not appear again.
 </p>
 <p>
 jDip will attempt to open the game using the available version. If compatibility
 issues occur, they may be remedied by installing the correct version variant
 in the variant directory. Multiple different versions of the same variant may
 coexist.
