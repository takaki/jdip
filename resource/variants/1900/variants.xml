		<DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[
		<p style="margin-top:0pt;">
		The 1900 variant of Diplomacy is an attempt to take the
		standard game and improve it by balancing the main powers
		while increasing historical accuracy and player interaction.
		</p>
		<h2>Rules</h2>
		<ol>
		<li>
			The rules of "standard" Diplomacy are valid, unless specifically
			replaced or amended by these rules.
		</li>
		<li>
			If a Great Power gains control of 18 SCs, the game ends and the 
			player controlling that Great Power is declared the winner. 
			With 39 SCs, though, it is now possible for two Great Powers to 
			get 18 SCs on the same game-turn. Should this happen, the player 
			representing the Great Power with the most SCs is the winner. 
			If the two Great Powers each control the same number of SCs, play 
			continues until one Great Power controls at least 18 SCs and that 
			Great Power controls more SCs than any other Great Power.
		</li>
		<li>
			Iceland, Ireland, and Switzerland are now passable.
		</li>
		<li>
			Movement between Clyde and Ireland is allowed. This is true even 
			if an enemy fleet is in the North Atlantic Ocean. A convoy is not 
			required to move an army back and forth between Clyde and Ireland.
		</li>
		<li>
			Army movement is allowed between Gibraltar and Morocco. No convoy 
			is required in this case. Gibraltar is considered a sea space for 
			convoy purposes.
		</li>
		<li>
			None of the Great Powers can build new units in Africa even if 
			they control a space in Africa at game-start.
		</li>
		<li>
			The <b>Suez Canal Rules</b> go like this:
			<ul>

			<li>
			A fleet may move back and forth between Egypt and Hejaz.
			</li>
			<li>
			Movement between Egypt or Hejaz and the Mid-Atlantic Ocean is 
			allowed. It is assumed the unit travels around the southern tip of 
			Africa. A unit that moves in this manner does so at half strength. 
			This means that a unit adjacent to Egypt or Hejaz succeeds in 
			moving there if opposed only by a fleet moving from the 
			Mid-Atlantic Ocean and a fleet adjacent to the Mid-Atlantic Ocean 
			succeeds in moving there if opposed only by a fleet moving from 
			Egypt or Hejaz.
			</li>
			<li>
			A fleet in Egypt or Hejaz cannot support a unit holding in or 
			moving to the Mid-Atlantic Ocean.  This is true even though the 
			fleet in Egypt or Hejaz can itself move to the Mid-Atlantic Ocean. 
			Likewise, a fleet in the Mid-Atlantic Ocean cannot support a unit 
			holding in or moving to Egypt or Hejaz.
			</li>
			<li>
			A fleet moving from Egypt or Hejaz to the Mid-Atlantic Ocean does 
			not cut support being provided by a fleet already in the 
			Mid-Atlantic Ocean unless the attack results in F Mid-Atlantic 
			Ocean being dislodged. The opposite is equally true. A fleet moving 
			from the Mid-Atlantic Ocean to Egypt or Hejaz does not cut support 
			being provided by a unit already in Egypt or Hejaz unless the 
			attack results in the unit being dislodged.
			</li>
			<li>
			F Mid-Atlantic Ocean can convoy an army from or to Egypt or Hejaz. 
			An army convoyed from Egypt or Hejaz attacks its destination space 
			at full strength. An army convoyed to Egypt or Hejaz attacks at 
			half strength.
			</li>
			<li>
			If two units may retreat only to Egypt or Hejaz, or the Mid-Atlantic 
			Ocean, and one of them must travel around the southern tip of 
			Africa, the unit that does not travel around southern Africa may 
			retreat while the other unit is disbanded. Similarly, if two units 
			are retreating to Egypt or Hejaz, or the Mid-Atlantic Ocean, and 
			one of them must travel around the southern tip of Africa, the unit 
			that does not travel around southern Africa may retreat while the 
			other unit is disbanded.
			</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			The <b>Steamroller Rule</b> reflects the seemingly endless reserves 
			of manpower that were available to the Tsar at the turn of the 
			century. In game terms, Russia is allowed to have one additional 
			unit while it controls at least one of the four Russian home SCs. 
			If other Powers control of all four Russian home SCs, with control 
			being determined after the Fall retreats, the ability to maintain 
			an additional unit is lost and Russia may only field a number of 
			units equal to the number of SCs it actually controls. Should 
			Russia regain a home SC, it would again be eligible to field an 
			additional unit, though this unit would need to be built in an open 
			home SC as per normal build rules. Note that the additional unit 
			does not appear at the start of the game, as there is no vacant 
			home SC to put it in.
		</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>GM Notes</h2>
		<p style="margin-top:0pt;">
			The Suez Canal Rules will have to be adjudicated manually as half 
			strength attacks are not supported by the current version of jDip.
		</p>
		<p>
			Russia is assigned an additional dummy Supply Centre to allow for 
			the Steamroller rule. Should Russia lose all its home SCs, the 
			additional unit will have to be deleted manually.
