		<DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[
		<p>
			The judge version was designed by Nicholas Fitzpatrick, based very heavily on Rod Walker's Aberration III. 
		</p>
		<h2>Rules</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Except as noted below, the standard rules of play for Diplomacy on the judge apply.</li>
			<li>There are 9 great powers. The Sicilian player must use the letter "C" rather than "S" when signing on 
			since "S" is reserved for Spain, and the Byzantine player must use "Z" rather than "B" as "B" is reserved for 
			"Burgundy". The starting units are as follows:
			<div class="indent1cm" style="margin-top:7pt;">
				<b>Burgundy (B):</b> A Dijon, A Brussels, F Hague<br>
				<b>Sicily (C):</b> A Rome , F Naples, F Palermo<br>
				<b>Eire (E):</b> A Alcluyd, F Dublin, F Edinburgh<br>
				<b>Hungary (H):</b> A Budapest, A Szeged, F Zara<br>
				<b>Israel (I):</b> A Damascus, A Jerusalem, F Cairo<br>
				<b>Poland (P):</b> A Warsaw, A Riga, F Gdansk<br>
				<b>Spain (S):</b> A Toledo, F Santander, F Valencia<br>
				<b>Ukraine (U):</b> A Kiev, A Odessa, F Yalta<br>
				<b>Byzantium (z):</b> A Athens, F Constantinople, F Smyrna<br>
			</div></li>
			<li>A player may build on any supply centre he/she owns which is vacant as long as he/she still own atleast 
			one of his/her original centres.</li>
			<li>Six provinces have interior waterways, inland canals, or bordering canals. Each of these provinces operates 
			exactly as does Kiel, Constantinople or Denmark in the regular game. They are: Cairo, Constantinople, Denmark, 
			Holstein, Sinai, and Taurida. The Suez canal separates the provinces of Sinai and Cairo, units can pass from 
			Sinai to Cairo. So in one turn the moves F Delta Sea-Sinai and F Red Sea-Cairo would both succeed.</li>
			<li>The Caspian Sea, Crete, Iceland, Corsica and any other unnamed space is not passable.</li>
			<li>There are 52 supply centres. The victory criterion is possession of 27 supply centres at the end of any 
			Fall retreat.</li>
			<li>There are 52 supply centres. The victory criterion is possession of 27 supply centres at the end of any 
			Fall retreat.</li>
			<li>The game begins in 1901.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Scenario</h2>
		<p>
			Here are some brief suggestions to what may have happened to these powers such that they achieved greatness, 
			while those that we know so well didn't.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Burgundy</i>: The final confrontation between the civilization of the Seine and the Saone was no sure thing 
			for the Parisian monarch. In this instance the victor was the Burgundian dynastic state, stretching from the 
			Rhone to the North Sea.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Byzantium</i>: This empire might have survived had the Turks failed to make a landing in Europe. The 
			population of western Asia Minor was still basically Greek in the 1400s. Some strong emperors could have given 
			the Greek state a new lease on life.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Hungary</i>: She was a budding great power until the Turkish invasions. A strong Byzantium would have 
			prevented that and Hungary, not Austria, could have become the great Danubian power.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Eire</i>: If Irish missionary activity had been followed by political action on behalf of their fellow celts, 
			the Anglo-Norman imperium at London might have been still-born. All the Irish needed was some real unity, which 
			the almost achieved on occasion.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Israel</i>: This could be a continuation of the ancient dynastic state under descendants of the Maccabees, or 
			the Herods. More likely, however, it would be representative of the final victory of the Crusaders in the Middle 
			East. It might therefore be called the "Kingdom of Jerusalem"
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Poland</i>: The Poles had many opportunities to overwhelm both the Russian and the eastern Germans. We must 
			here assume that one opportunity finally worked.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Sicily</i>: This island once had an excellent chance of gaining control of most of Italy under a powerful and 
			aggressive Norman dynasty. These rulers died out, and Sicily became the pawn of others. Here we assume that the 
			Norman dynasty did not die out.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Spain</i>: The could be a Christian Spain which somehow remained powerful despite a long succession of 
			cretinous monarchs. Perhaps they were spared the third-rate Hapsburgs and Bourbons which were thrust upon them. 
			OR this is a Muslim Spain, which case we should refer to it as the "Caliphate of Toledo" (a change of capital 
			from Cordova).
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Ukraine</i>: The original Russian state was centred at Kiev, and we suppose here that this southern centre 
			remained dominant rather than losing out to the northern centres at Vladimir and Moscow. These people would, 
			however, continue to call their land "Russia" or something like it.
		</p>
		<p>
		<h2>Differences from Aberration III</h2>
		</p>
		<p>
			Some changes were made to Aberration III, to allow it to be played on a judge.
		</p>
		<p>
			The West, South and East Africa spaces were eliminated. The naval shipyard in Karelia was removed. In addition, 
			some spaces had their names altered or changed, and a name Lemberg was given to a province whose name had been 
			left off the NAVB map.
